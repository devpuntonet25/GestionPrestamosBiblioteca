Right now this project is in its building process, so what we can see is how entities are mapped, how we manage relationships with hibernate,
how to work with JPA, how to create controllers, services and repositories, how to implement this information with H2 embedded database, 
and what we can see in action are all the endpoints related to the author entity, so we can see how pagination is done, how to sort Authors by some fields,
how to get all the authors that have some specific citizenship, among other things.
